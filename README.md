# Analysis of Housing Affordability & Safety near LSE

A data science project analyzing the London rental market to identify safe, affordable housing options for students at the London School of Economics (LSE). This project scrapes real-time property data, integrates crime statistics via government APIs, and performs regression analysis to optimize student housing decisions.

**Project Status:** Completed (April 2024)

## 📌 Project Overview
With London rental prices rising significantly (11.8% in 2023), students often struggle to find accommodation that balances cost, safety, and proximity to campus. This project aims to answer:
* How does distance from LSE quantify into rental savings?
* Which postcodes offer the best safety-to-price ratio?
* How does number of bedrooms in a property impact price per person?
* Is it cheaper to move into private housing or stay in student halls?

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
* **Language:** Python
* **Data Collection:** Selenium, BeautifulSoup4, Requests
* **APIs:** Police.uk (Crime statistics), Postcodes.io (Geolocation)
* **Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels
* **Visualization:** Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib

### Key Technical Highlights
* **Dynamic Web Scraping:** Utilized **Selenium** to handle dynamic JavaScript content on OpenRent, specifically to interact with embedded Google Maps elements to extract precise latitude/longitude coordinates for every property.
* **Multithreading:** Implemented a custom `TaskQueue` using Python's `threading` library to parallelize the scraping of individual property pages.
    * *Note:* The scraper was intentionally limited to **2 concurrent workers**. While the architecture supports higher concurrency, this limit was enforced to respect the target website's rate limits and prevent IP bans during the data acquisition phase (~70-minute runtime for 750+ properties). Note the relatively long time to run this webscraping comes from the need for interaction with the Google Maps box on each property's page.
* **Data Fusion:** Merged scraped rental data with crime data (crimes within a 1-mile radius) fetched dynamically from the Police.uk API based on property coordinates.

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `Analysis of housing in the proximity of LSE.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the scraper, data cleaning, and analysis pipeline.
* `Analysis of housing in the proximity of LSE.html`: An HTML with the complete code, outputs, and analysis.
* `data/`: Contains the datasets generated by the project (JSON/CSV) to ensure reproducibility without re-running the time-intensive scraper.
    * `private_and_lse_final_info.csv`: The complete dataset of private rentals + LSE accommodations + crime stats. Intermediate data sets include:
        * `private_property_info.json`: Web-scraped private property data.
        * `private_property_info_with_crimes_number.json`: Merged private rentals data + Police.uk crime stats.
        * `final_lse_accomm_info.csv`: Comparative data for LSE student halls, including crime stats.

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/petkovip/london-housing-analysis-lse.git](https://github.com/petkovip/london-housing-analysis-lse.git)
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Launch the Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Analysis of housing in the proximity of LSE.ipynb"
    ```
    * **Note:** The notebook is configured to load the pre-scraped data from the `data/` folder by default. If you wish to re-run the scraping process, ensure you have the Chrome WebDriver installed and be aware that the scraping cells take ~70+ minutes to execute.

## 📊 Key Findings
* **The Commute Trade-off:** Regression analysis quantified exactly how much rental prices drop per kilometer moved away from the LSE campus.
* **Safety Correlation:** Identified specific postcodes where lower rent did not necessitate a statistically significant compromise on safety (crime rates).
* **Halls vs. Private:** Comparative analysis of price-per-bedroom in private flats versus standard LSE student accommodation rates.
